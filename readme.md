Week 3 Friday Lab - As Group work for week 4

Team: Gregory Potter, Tristan Stringfellow


Question:
DevOps Lifecycle with AWS:

In this project, youâ€™ll be creating the infra using terraform and will perform application/tool stack configuration and will effectively use Jenkins for running automated CICD for both the application and infra deployment. Provisioning a managed EKS cluster and setting up a mutable environment setup which ensures the HA and Resilience of the application.

Project Status:

good - terraform creation works

good - jenkins is running

pending - pipeline issues because of kubectl version issues

pending - issues with creating nodes
